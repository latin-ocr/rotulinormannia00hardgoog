. Independently of the omissione in Certe, errors of some
importance exist in the dates of instrumente referred to:
for instance, the Vascon Roll for the aoth of King Henry
the Third is stated to be a record of the l6th year of that
reign, an extraordinary mistake3 for on that very Roll
many important documenta are to be found relative to the
battle of Taillebourgh, fought between St. Louis and
Henry the Third, in the year lasa, ten years aster the date
assigned to it in the catalogum an error in date which the
editors of the last edition of the Foedera have implicitly
followed. This is certainlya singular mistake for Certe
not to have discovered, who is admitted to be an his2
torian of no mean capacity and research. These remarks
upon the imperfectioris in the Catalogue edited by him
'are not intended to cast a stigma upon that publication,
but made with the view of vindicating the expediency
of giving these valuable muniments themselves to the
public, in an authentia and authorised manner¹, especially
as they contain numerous facts relating to the wars be-
tween England and France, from the commencement of
the thirteenth to the middle of the fisteenth century,
which illustrate the general and particular history of both
kingdoms, and many of which have hitherto been scarcely
noticed by the writers of either nation.

THE NORMAN ROLLS.

This volume contains such of the Nonunw Rotas of
the reign of King J ohn as are now extant in the Tower,

1 Barrington, in his Observations ou the more ancient statutas, speak-
ing of Curte’s Catalogues of the Norman, French, and Gascon Rolls,
remarks, “ That the titles only os these Records make two folio volumen

“ it would certainly, however, be a work deserving the encouragement
“ of both natione, and of all learned uren throughout Europe, to print
“ these instrumente at length.” p. 75.
