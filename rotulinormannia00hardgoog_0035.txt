The Roll intituled ‘⁶ Rorurus ns Vnone Transeunt
Nouissimas? appears to be one of a series, but is the
only one extant. It specifies the value of the lands in
England holden by Normans in rebellion against the King
of England‚ and which escheated to the English crownr
Whilst Normandy was under the ohedience of England3
the English held lands there by hereditary right, as did
the Normans in England. But upon the separation of
the two dominionS, the King of France seized the pos·
sessions of the English in Normandy, and the King of
England in like manner seized those os the Normans in
England. This Roll gives a curious and minute account
of the value oflend, cattle, and agricultural produce at

thatperiod.
