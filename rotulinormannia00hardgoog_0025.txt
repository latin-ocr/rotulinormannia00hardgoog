form, language‚ and writing, to the Close and other Rolls
of the same period. It must not, however, be supposed

that the Norman Rolls comprise every particular con-

² and Charter Rolls, for the first five years of the reign of

John, also contain numerous entries relating to those pro-

Rolls, and Close Letters both on the Patent and Charter,

this assertion.
