PREFACE. irs

To this just description of the defects of Carte’s
Catalogue little need be added: but it may be proper to
state that, instead of exaggerating‚ Brequigny has greatly
uuderrated the deficiencies of that work. For instance,
hom page us] to page 246, in the first volume, only one
hundred and siutynr'ne instruments are noticed as being

entered on the Norman Rolls in the reign of King John,
whereas no less than nine hundred ond twenty-eight in·
struments are to be found thereon3 and neither the Roll
of the eth, nor the fragment of the 5th year of that reign
are even referred to. Again, with respect to the Roll
of the 5th of Henry the F ifth, the Catalogue mentions

two hundred ond ninety-one instruments, whilst the roll
itself contains upwards offive hundred.

1 In the catalogue printed by Certe, ‘the description of
the various documents are also so extremely meagre, as to
give a very inadequute idea of the instruments themselves.
Thus, “ de protectionibus concessis personis, et vicariis
“ ac capellanis infra ducatum Normanniae, nominatim ’ἶ
(page 254) is the only indication which occurs of the
whole of the important matter between pages 834 and
347 of this volume. The interesting document which is
merely alluded to by “ de licentia data quamplurimis
“ magistris navium, qui ad deserviendum Regi in viagio
“ suo ad partes Franciae vadia perceperant, versus partes
“ suas proprias transeundi‚'' contains the list of those
ships, with the names of their masters or commandens,
and of the ports to which they belonged, which conveyed
Henry the Fisth and his army to Normandy, in the mouth
ofJuly1417.¹ ·

¹The muster roll of that expedition is preserved in the Chapter'
House, westminster, and is oue of the most interesting Records of
military history now extant
