xxxvi PREFACE:

first part of either of those names is eight3 and, as clue·
ters like these, of several upright parallel strokes‚ fre-
quently occur, the difficulty of determining upon the
right reading may easily be conceived. There is
another cause of confusion upon which aremark is
necessary. Hitherto‚ in publications of records, words
ending in tio, &c have, with much impropriety‚ been
invariably spelt with a o, instead of the t. That mode
is here pursued, wherever it had the appearance of
c, but not otherwise; for a manifest difference is osten
perceptible, in the early Rolls, between the two letters,
especially in words where o and t stand in juxtaposition 3
for instance, in rectum and rettotus, bc. Again‚ there
are cases wherein the t occurs by itself, in substitution
for which a c is so decidedly inadrnissible, that the Editor
has not adopted it, but it is not improbable that an oc-
casional error may be found to arise from the difficulty of
always distinguishing between the c and t¹, from the
great similarity in the formation of those two letters by
some scribes.'’²

¹ For instance, the name of Wancy has the appearance on the roll of
Wauty, and has been more thau once so read.
