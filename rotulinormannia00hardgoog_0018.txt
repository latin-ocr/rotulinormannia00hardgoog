ir PREFACE.

Valuable as Carte’s publication undoubtedly ir, and
interesting as it may have been to Francet yet it is a very
imperfect work3 for it does not refer to even a tenth part
of the documents enrolled. It must, however, be said, in
ustice to Carte, that he merely printed the calendars²
which he found in the Tower 3 and that he was induced
to do so from a feeling of gratitude for the kindness he
had experienced during six years residence in France3
facts which ought to remove from that eminent writer
the reproach of having published so incompleta a work.

The defecta in Carte's Catalogue were first noticed by
M. de Brequigny³ in a communication to the Memoires

¹ Mr. Cooper, in his work upon the Public Records, vol. i. p. 303, has
extracted a passage fromari article in the Quarterly Review (vol. xxxix.
p. 52. 53), stating that the publication of Carte's catalogue was orread
aioned by an erret, in the nature of a general “ quo warranto informa·
tion,'' issued by Cardinal Fleury, by which he attached the franchises of
the religione and civil corporations of France. Every search hasbeen
made for such an erret, but without success: neither has Carte, in his
preface, nor any Freuch historiari, alluded to such a circumstance. The
writer in the Revierr is most probably mistaken, or has at least founded
his assertion on a paragraph in Barrington’s Observations upon the Sta-
tute of Gloucester, temp. Edw. Ι.

² “ Je me suis propose de remedier, par rapport a la France, aux incon·
veniens qui ont rcndu jusqu’a present inutiles les recherches des titres
qui l'interessent. Ayant passe plusieurs euntes d fouiller daus les
differentes archives d’Angleterre, alin d'y recueillir les memoires et les
materiaux, dont j'avois besoin pour la nouvelle histoire de ce royaume
a laquelle je travaille, j'ai leit faire avec soin des copies exactas de tous
les catalogues ou schedules des rolles contenues dans ces archiver (de
la Tour de Londres,) et en 'particulier celles des Rolles Gascons, Nor·
mans, et Francoisl’ Prffoce au Catuloyue des Roller Garmias, Numam,
et Franpois.
